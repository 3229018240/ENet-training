# ENet

This work has been published in arXiv: [`ENet: A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02147).

## Packages:

* [train](train) contains tools for training network using various architectures. It can be further used for visulaization of network's performance. This section is mainly for pixelwise segmentation and scene-parsing.
* [visualize](visualize) can be used to view the performance of trained network on any video/image as an overlay. (Will be added soon)
* [dataset](dataset/CamVid) has downsampled CamVid dataset compatible with our data loader.
